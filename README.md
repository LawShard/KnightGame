# First Project in Godot

This is the first project I created using **Godot**, an open-source and versatile game engine. I decided to develop a **2D platformer** game, inspired by the classic style of **Mario Bros**, in order to learn the basics of the engine and understand how to handle the essential elements required to create an interactive game.

Throughout this project, I was able to put into practice various aspects of game development, from creating characters and enemies to implementing physics and animations. This project allowed me to experiment with fundamental tools in Godot and take my first steps into the world of game development.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project was to learn how to use **Godot** at a basic level, in order to understand how the engine works and familiarize myself with its key features. I wanted to experiment with the process of creating a game from scratch, addressing aspects like character programming, movement mechanics, physics implementation, level integration, and the use of resources like animations and sound. Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of the key concepts I will apply in future projects.

## Things I Learned While Working on the Project

1. **Physics and gravity**: Implementing physics for characters and objects, including gravity.
2. **Creating a level**: Designing levels and their structure.
3. **Creating enemies with movement patterns**: Developing enemies that follow a predefined behavior.
4. **Using Raycast**: Implementing raycasting to detect collisions and areas of interest.
5. **Creating and using animations (idle, run, jump)**: Integrating animations for different character actions.
6. **Level transitions**: Implementing a system to transition between different levels or screens.
7. **Creating collectibles**: Designing and integrating collectible objects into the game.
8. **Using autoload files**: Implementing autoload files to manage global data and scenes.
9. **Adding music**: Integrating music and sound effects to enhance the game experience.
